TDAT:    public boolean getAutoCommit() throws SQLException {
      //throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Connection.getAutoCommit() unsupported");
      return false; // at present this is just a read only driver: you can't do update/insert operations -> it
      				  // makes no sense giving the chance to set auto commit, so this is always false
   }

COM:returns a boolean indicating whether auto commit is enabled for a database connection, and always returns false since the driver only supports read-only operations
